# webHotels
This is a project for CS Technical School on Web Development.
It is not really good looking and needs SO much improving 
so I'll try to improve it in the future.
The page is supposed to be a Hotel Information page.
It's purpose is for users to find basic information about hotels and for hotel owners to register their own hotel.
In this I am implementing some basic website mechanics, such as:
Sign up and Sign in, User Verification via email, Search Page with criteria and Image Upload.
