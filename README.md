# webHotels
This is a project for CS Technical School on Web Development and also my first website. The assignment was for the site to be built from scratch without using a framework. \n
It's purpose is for users to find basic information about hotels and for hotel owners to register their own hotel.
In this I am implementing some basic website mechanics, such as:
Sign up and Sign in, User Verification via email, Search with multiple criteria and Image Upload.
Technologies used: \n
PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, MySQL, AJAX
