# webHotels
This is a project for CS Technical School on Web Development.
It has many issues and needs SO much improving but i am running out of time,
so I'll try to improve it as much as I can before the deadline.
I AM going to work on it after I submit it though, to make it actually good.
The page is supposed to be a Hotel Info page. Something like booking.com but without the booking part.
It has the following parts: 
1) Login 2) Register User 3) Register Hotel 4) Upload Pictures 5) Search for Hotels 
Login and Register User are working just fine. Register hotel was also wokring fine but something is wrong now.
Trying to figura out what is it. Upload pictures is working but would be better. Also it has an issue that i need to correct,
but i think i can manage it. Search is also working very well.
We were instructed not to give too muh attention to the appearance of the page, but to focus in it working good,
so I didn't focus too much on appearance.
